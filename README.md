## Development technologies used

**Ruff**: Ruff is integrated into the repository to streamline code linting and formatting.
It ensures consistent code style across the project and helps maintain code quality.

**pre-commit**: Pre-commit hooks are set up to run various checks, such as code formatting with black and code linting with flake8, before each commit.
This helps catch potential issues early in the development process and ensures that all commits adhere to the project's coding standards.

**pip**: Pip is utilized as the package manager for installing Python dependencies required for development and running the project.
It simplifies the management of project dependencies and allows for easy installation of required packages.

**tensorflow**: TensorFlow is an important component of the repository, serving as the primary deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.
It provides tools and utilities for developing machine learning models, including neural network architectures, optimization algorithms, and evaluation metrics.
TensorFlow's versatility and extensive documentation make it well-suited for implementing complex deep learning algorithms and experiments.
